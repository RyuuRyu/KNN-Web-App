# About this Project
This is Python based Machine Learning Model using K-Nearest Neighbors Algorythm for predicting college student's graduation based on their attendance, assignments and exams scores, and their GPA.
I made as an object of my 6th Semester scientific papers.

## Python

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including:
- structured (particularly procedural)
- object-oriented and functional programming.
It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

## K-Nearest Neighbors
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a non-parametric, supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. In Python, the scikit-learn library provides a robust and easy-to-use implementation of KNN. 

## How KNN works:

- Define k: Choose the number of nearest neighbors (k) to consider.
- Calculate Distances: For a new, unclassified data point, calculate its distance (e.g., Euclidean distance) to all data points in the training set.
- Find Nearest Neighbors: Identify the k data points from the training set that are closest to the new data point.
- Prediction: Classification, assign the new data point to the class that is most frequent among its k nearest neighbors (majority voting). Regression, Predict the value of the new data point as the average (or weighted average) of the values of its k nearest neighbors.
